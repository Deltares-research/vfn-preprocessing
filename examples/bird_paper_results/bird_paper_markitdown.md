Meadow bird species in the Netherlands have shown a long-term decline in
numbers. This has been generally attributed to agricultural intensification, but in
addition  an  increase  of  disturbing  elements  may  have  played  a  role  in  the
decline. In this review we compiled data from literature to explore to what extent
breeding by meadow birds (Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus,
Northern  Lapwing  Vanellus  vanellus,  Black-tailed  Godwit  Limosa  limosa)  is
limited by disturbing landscape elements. We considered elements that can be
considered ‘view-obstructing’ (like trees or houses), and those that can be con-
sidered  ‘flat’ (canal,  road  or  railway).  Our  review  shows  that  breeding  birds
keep a  distance to both types of landscape elements, with distances ranging
over  1  km  for  highways  and  village  edges.  Roads  with  high  traffic  intensity
caused the largest disturbance. Eurasian Oystercatcher was most tolerant to
the presence of landscape elements, and Black-tailed Godwit least tolerant.

In recent decades, populations of almost all meadow
bird species in The Netherlands have declined, resulting
in most of them being placed on the Dutch red list of
threatened bird species, including Black-tailed Godwit
Limosa limosa and Common Redshank Tringa totanus
(van Beusekom et al. 2005). This decline has been at-
tributed  to  several  factors,  including  collecting  eggs,
hunting  and  alterations  of  habitat  (Klomp 1951,
Wymenga & Engelmoer 2001). However, it is now gen-
erally accepted that the decline has been mostly caused
by  a  continuing  intensification  of  agriculture  in  the
breeding areas impairing reproductive success, for in-
stance by an increased intensity of farmers’ activities,
increasing livestock densities, earlier and more frequent
mowing,  and
levels
(Beintema & Müskens 1987, Kruk 1993, Vickery et al.
2001, Newton 2004).

lowering  of  groundwater

Another  reason  for  the  decline  that  has  gained
much less attention is that opportunities for safe breed-

ing by meadow birds are hampered by an increase of
elements that obstruct visibility in the otherwise open
habitat (Dyrcz et al. 1981, van der Vliet et al. 2008).
Klomp  (1954)  showed  that  Northern  Lapwings  were
most effective in deterring potential predators in a tree-
less landscape, and calculated that Lapwings needed a
field  of  at  least  5 ha  in  size  if  lined  by  trees  with  a
height of 6–10 m.

In  this  paper,  we  review  effects  of  landscape  ele-
ments on the breeding distribution of meadow birds,
focusing on the species for which sufficient data have
been  published,    Eurasian  Oystercatcher  Haematopus
ostralegus,  Northern  Lapwing  Vanellus  vanellus,  and
Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa. Meadow birds keep
a distance to elements in the landscape, thus resulting
locally in lowered meadow bird densities. The distance
where the population density is depressed due to the
presence of a disturbing source is called the disturbance
distance (cf. Veen 1973, van der Zande et al. 1980, Gill

et al. 1996, Reijnen et al. 1996). The maximum distur-
bance distance is defined as the largest distance where
a negative effect is still measurable. We use this maxi-
mum disturbance distance as an indicator of the effect
that a landscape element may have on suitable habitat
and on the distribution of meadow birds.

We aim to distinguish between two sources of dis-
turbance, (1) elements that hamper visibility (view-ob-
structing elements), and (2) flat elements that cause
disturbance  by  the  presence  of  potential  predators
without  impairing  visibility  (canals,  roads  and  rail-
ways). By using data on traffic intensity we separate ef-
fects  of  the  flat  elements  proper  and  the  presence  of
‘predators’.  Thus,  based  on  a  literature  review,  this
paper  gives  an  indication  to  what  extent  different
sources of disturbance limit the distribution of breeding
meadow birds. Forman & Alexander (1998) reviewed
the  disturbance  caused  by  roads  on  wildlife.  We  use
their framework to discuss our findings.

METHODS

To quantify the effects of elements in the landscape on
meadow  bird  populations,  we  searched  literature
sources  for  quoted  disturbance  distances,  using  both
widely available and grey literature. We assumed that
distances to field borders were negligible compared to
the distance to landscape elements. We aimed to find
figures for the disturbance distance for the three species
separately but unfortunately not all sources made this
distinction. Many studies were carried out in western
Netherlands,  where  most  Dutch  meadow  birds  breed
(Bijlsma et al. 2001). In most study sites, habitat was
homogeneous,  although  some  were  heterogeneous
with respect to meadow vegetation type. We only in-
cluded studies that had considered this heterogeneity
in their conclusions. Also, most studies distinguished
between  roads  with  or  without  a  supporting  view-
obstructing  element.  If  they  did,  we  also  made  this
distinction in our categories of elements. Studies calcu-
lated distances by either interpreting numbers of breed-
ing meadow birds along a transect perpendicular to the
disturbing  source,  or  by  interpreting  field  data  after-
wards.

Effects by landscape elements on disturbance dis-
tances  were  statistically  tested  for  each  species  sepa-
rately and for the species pooled. View obstruction and
traffic intensity were the independent variables. Based
on the original publications, traffic intensity was scored
as ‘low’ (values 0 and 1), ‘intermediate’ (value 2), and
‘high’ (value 3). Note that both view-obstructing and

flat  elements  can  have  a  high  intensity  of  traffic.
Unfortunately, inclusion of species as an independent
variable led to strong deviations from normality, even
after log-transformation of the data.

The effect of view obstruction and traffic intensity
on  the  average  disturbance  distance  was  tested  by
ANOVAs. A Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to identi-
fy significant differences between levels of traffic inten-
sity.  Data  were  log-transformed  as  data  assumptions
were not met, but for Eurasian Oystercatcher log-trans-
formation did not lead to improvement. Non-paramet-
ric tests were therefore used for this species to test main
effects. Because these tests yielded similar results as the
ANOVA, we only present the results of the latter. To test
whether  the  presence  of  disturbing  elements  caused
lower  densities  within  500 m  from  the  element,  we
used  a  series  of  χ2-tests.  As  a  preliminary  log-linear
analysis  showed  no  significant  interactions  between
variables, separate χ2-tests were made. This could only
be  performed  for  all  species  pooled  due  to  the  small
amount of data for each species separately. To test for
species-specific  avoidance  distances,  we  included
species as a third independent variable.

RESULTS

Visual inspection of Table 1 shows a large variation in
the  distance  that  meadow  birds  keep  from  view-ob-
structing and flat elements. The largest disturbance dis-
tance  (>1  km)  was  reported  for  the  high-intensively
used highways. However, flat elements with low traffic
intensity like cycle paths also resulted in disturbance
distances of 100 m or more. Among view-obstructing
elements, ‘edge of a village or city’ caused the largest
disturbance distance. Forest edges, hedges or reed beds,
–  elements  without  traffic  –  showed  disturbance  dis-
tances of up to 350 m (Table 1). Traffic intensity was
the only parameter that influenced breeding distance
significantly (χ2 = 8.85, P = 0.012). At the lowest traf-
fic intensity, disturbance distance was less than 500 m
in 71% of the cases, whereas at intermediate and high
traffic  intensities  this  value  was  as  low  as  30%  and
18%, respectively.

Eurasian Oystercatcher showed the smallest distur-
bance  distance  in  nine  between-species  comparisons,
Northern  Lapwing  in  three  comparisons,  and  Black-
tailed Godwit in none of the comparisons (Table 1).

ANOVA-tests confirmed that Northern Lapwing and
Black-tailed  Godwit  were  significantly  affected  by
traffic  intensity,  but  Eurasian  Oystercatcher  was  not
(Table 2). In Northern Lapwing, post-hoc tests showed

significant differences in disturbance distance between
the three categories, with shorter distances at low in-
tensities  and  larger  distances  at  high  intensities.  In
Black-tailed Godwit, distances were longer at high traf-
fic intensities in comparison to intermediate and low
traffic intensity. Disturbance distances were not affect-
ed  by  view-obstructing  elements  (Table  2).  When  all
species were pooled, no significant effect of any of the
landscape element characteristics were found (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Possible ecological explanations
Our review supports the notion that Northern Lapwing
and Black-tailed Godwit keep distances from elements
with  elevated  traffic  intensity.  Forman  &  Alexander
(1998) list several factors that can cause disturbance by
roads  for  breeding  birds:  pollutants,  noise,  direct
human presence, and loss of visibility. Below we discuss
the relevance of these four factors for the disturbance
distances that we found. (1) Pollutants like lead have
an effect over distances that are much smaller than the
disturbance distances than we compiled from literature
(cf. Reijnen et al. 1996 and Table 1). Furthermore, an
effect  of  pollutants  does  not  explain  distances  as  ob-
served for natural elements like forests. This factor does
not seem to have much weight in explaining the distri-
bution of meadow birds. (2) Reijnen et al. (1996) pos-
tulated that noise, rather than visual stimuli, explained
disturbance distances by roads. Indeed, we found the
largest disturbance distance for highways, which can be
considered  the  noisiest  landscape  element  (Table  1).
Despite this, noise may not be the only explanation for
meadow bird species as they use visual cues as well as
sounds  in  e.g.  their  display  behaviour.  (3)  Similarly,
disturbance  by  man  is  an  important  cause  of  distur-
bance given that the largest disturbance distances were
associated with highest traffic intensity (Table 1). Also,

objects  with  the  lowest  traffic  intensity,  like  minor
roads  and  cycle  paths,  have  smaller  disturbance  dis-
tances than for instance highways (Table 1). However,
as human disturbance is often a combination of noise
and traffic it is difficult to distinguish between the most
important  underlying  reason.  (4)  Because  meadow
birds give priority to detect predators (van der Vliet et
al. 2008), lack of visibility to scan for predators, must
also partially explain disturbance distances for meadow
birds  –  in  line  with  the  fourth  explanation  given  by
Forman  &  Alexander  (1998).  Indeed,  elements  not
used by man equally had large disturbance distances.

In  landscapes  with  view-obstructing  elements,
meadow birds prefer breeding further away from perch-
es used by avian predators, resulting in decreased pre-
dation rates (Berg et al. 1992, Johansson 2001, contra
Ottvall et al. 2005, Wallander et al. 2006). For preda-
tors,  a  landscape  with  elements  is  attractive  due  to
availability of suitable nesting sites and, for avian pred-
ators, perching opportunities (Preston 1957, Galbraith
1989,  Andrén  1992,  Brandsma  1992).  Furthermore,
predators may use landscape elements as a hiding place
when attacked by meadow birds (Elliot 1985). Finally,
an open landscape may make avian predators more sus-
ceptible to stronger wind blows, which reduces the suc-
cess  rate  of  their  attacks  on  potential  prey  (Quinn  &
Cresswell 2004). It is therefore not surprising that pre-
dation rates for meadow birds have been found to be
especially high in a landscape with scattered trees, tree
lines or other elements (Wymenga & Engelmoer 2001).
More research is needed to elucidate the ecological un-
derstanding of disturbance distances caused by land-
scape elements to meadow birds, e.g. the differences
between element types, and also the influence of ele-
ments for each species separately.

Data variability and uncertainty
There are several weaknesses in the data sets we used
(Table 1; also van der Zande et al. 1980, Altenburg &

Wymenga  1987).  Most  importantly,  in  most  studies
meadow birds were studied as one group for which the
response by an element was considered the same for all
species (e.g. Veen 1973, Altenburg & Wymenga 1987,
Brandsma 1991). However, in reality the impact of the
element  is  likely  to  be  species  specific  (e.g.  van  der
Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Another point
of concern is a very high variability in disturbance dis-
tances. This effect is most obvious for the disturbance
caused  by  roads.  For  instance  for  Eurasian  Oyster-
catcher, estimates for disturbance distance from high-
ways with 5000 to 10,000 cars a day vary from 0 to
1700 meters (Table 1). Furthermore, it should be noted
that several studies did not take into account effects by
direct human disturbance. Finally, in some studies, data
have  been  collected  in  relatively  small  areas,  where
other  factors,  not  quantified  or  perhaps  overlooked,
may have played a role.

Implications for conservation of the landscape
Our  review  shows  that  still  little  is  known  how  ele-
ments in the landscape influence the breeding distribu-
tion of meadow birds. Highways resulted in the highest
reported disturbance distances (Table 1). For the west-
ern part of The Netherlands, 16% less pairs of Black-
tailed Godwit were present because of the disturbance
distance along highways (Reijnen et al. 1997). We pre-
sume that with the ongoing alteration of the landscape
even fewer pairs are breeding as other elements add to
unsuitable habitat. Larsen & Madsen (2000) similarly
demonstrated  the  influence  of  view-obstructing  ele-
ments  in  open  grassland  habitats  for  wintering  Pink-
footed Goose Anser brachyrhynchus. They calculated an
effective loss of 68% of the total field area due to the
presence of view-obstructing elements.

In this respect, the extreme site fidelity shown by
meadow birds to the previous year’s breeding site, espe-
cially  when  a  breeding  attempt  has  been  successful
(Klomp  1954,  Thompson  &  Hale  1989,  Groen  1993,
Johansson 2001), may be a disadvantageous trait in a
changing landscape. It may lead to a higher extinction
risk  of  local  meadow  bird  populations  (Kruk  et al.
1998).  In  contrast,  in  an  unchanged  landscape,  ex-
treme site fidelity may be beneficiary from an evolu-
tionary  point-of-view,  as  the  birds  are  familiar  with
local environmental factors and, possibly, conspecifics
(Johansson 2001). Because of site fidelity, not only con-
tinuity  of  the  management  of  agricultural  fields
(Beintema & Rijk 1988, Beintema et al. 1995) but also
the conservation of an open landscape appears to be
essential for the conservation of meadow birds (van der
Vliet et al. 2008). We consider that the adverse effect of

development on openness, leading to a reduced preda-
tor visibility, may become a more important factor for
meadow birds in the near future.

(Mulder  1972).

On the positive side, meadow birds are known to
have  adapted  to  changes  in  their  breeding  habitat.
Mulder (1972) and Beintema et al. (1985) showed that
meadow birds were able to respond to the intensifica-
tion of agricultural management by breeding earlier in
response  to  an  earlier  start  of  agricultural  activities.
Likewise,  many  pairs  of  Eurasian  Oystercatcher  and
Northern  Lapwing  breed  in  arable  fields  nowadays
(Klomp 1954, Imboden 1970, Kooiker 1984, Galbraith
1989,  Berg  et al. 1992),  although  these  are  still
shunned  by  grassland  specialists  like  Black-tailed
Godwit
Incidentally,  Eurasian
Oystercatcher and Northern Lapwing are generally also
the  least  affected  by  the  presence  of  landscape  ele-
ments, whereas Black-tailed Godwit seems to be most
affected. It seems that meadow birds may also be able
to cope with the loss of predator visibility. De Molenaar
et al. (2000), for instance, found that birds that arrived
later at their breeding area chose their breeding sites
close to road illumination, because the earlier birds al-
ready bred at sites the farthest from this object. In this
way,  the  later  birds,  having  the  choice  between  no
breeding or breeding at a less favourable site, showed
to have adapted to a certain extent to the presence of
the disturbing object.

Many  policy  measures  have  been  taken  by  the
Dutch  government  to  preserve  meadow  bird  species,
and their habitat, because they are internationally im-
portant. Such measures have often been directed to the
improvement of nesting and recruitment success, and
include for instance creation of reserves, facilitation of
nest  protection  schemes  by  volunteers,  payment  to
farmers for successfully protecting nests while carrying
out  agricultural  activities,  and  payment  for  delay  of
agricultural  activities  during  the  breeding  season.
However, up to now such measures did not stop the de-
cline  of  meadow  bird  species  (e.g.  Kleijn  et al. 2001,
Berendse et al. 2004, Schekkerman 2008). One of the
reasons might be that the landscape context has so far
not been taken into account, making an effort to im-
prove  the  suitability  of  breeding  sites  less  successful.
For meadow bird conservation, priority should be given
to the protection of open and quiet landscapes (without
much human disturbance). If such landscapes are to be
disclosed,  sources  of  disturbance  of  the  landscape,
stemming from a loss of openness or from the presence
of human beings, should perhaps be concentrated. It
would  make  one  edge  of  the  meadow  bird  habitat
disturbed  but  would  leave  the  remainder  open  and

undisturbed.  We  argue  that,  before  taking  measures
directed to the benefit of breeding meadow birds, the
already  present  human  disturbance  in  and  the  open-
ness of the landscape should be considered.

SAMENVATTING

Weidevogels hebben een voorkeur voor een open landschap met
zo min mogelijk landschapselementen die hun blikveld in de
weg staan. Op deze manier kunnen predatoren op tijd worden
opgemerkt  en  weggejaagd.  Ook  platte  landschapselementen,
zoals wegen, zouden een verstoring van het blikveld kunnen op-
leveren door de bewegingen van de gebruikers van die elemen-
ten op de achtergrond. Het resultaat van deze verstoringen zou
kunnen  zijn  dat  weidevogels  een  afstand  tot  dergelijke  land-
schapselementen aanhouden bij de selectie van een geschikte
plek om te broeden, met als gevolg een verminderde dichtheid
in vergelijking tot een situatie waarbij deze elementen er niet
zouden  zijn  geweest.  Wij  hebben  in  de  literatuur  gezocht  of
hiervoor  aanwijzingen  zijn  te  vinden  voor  Scholekster
Haematopus ostralegus, Kievit Vanellus vanellus en Grutto Limosa
limosa. De resultaten van dit literatuuronderzoek laten zien dat
deze soorten inderdaad een afstand aanhouden tot beide typen
landschapselementen. Voor snelwegen en stads- en dorpsran-
den  kan  die  afstand  meer  dan  een  kilometer  bedragen.  De
grootste verstoringsafstand werd gevonden voor wegen met een
hoge  gebruikersdruk.  Maar  ook  natuurlijke  elementen,  zoals
bosranden en rietvelden, hebben een negatieve invloed op vesti-
gingsmogelijkheden voor weidevogels. De soorten verschillen
wel in hun tolerantie ten opzichte van de vestigingsmogelijk-
heid in zulke gebieden. De Scholekster is het meest tolerant, de
Grutto  het  minst.  Wij  beargumenteren  waarom  de  inrichting
van het landschap aandacht verdient tijdens de planning van be-
leid.
